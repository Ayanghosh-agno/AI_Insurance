The advent of the 𝐂𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐝-𝟏𝟗 has turned all of our lives upsides down. At present, the traditional way of interactng with the customer and insurance agent have been breaking since, **INSURANCE** companies are facing catastrophic challenges in providing proper facility and hasel free claim processing to its customers. Some traditional way of handling the customer and to file a claim or policy with help of agent is risky in this situation, visiting homes of various coustomer increases exposed contamination since it's time-consuming and often requires creating extensive schedule changes in one's daily routine. Moreover, Insurance-Company don’t have the capacity for handling large amount of customer just through the agents. Additionally, some agents may be often inadequate and lack personalization to handle the customer in a Smart way. 

## WHY AI/ML for Insurance-Companies?


   
Insurance is an old and highly regulated industry. Perhaps because of this, insurance companies have been slower to embrace technological change compared to other industries. Insurance is still steeped in manual, paper-based processes that are slow and require human intervention. Even today, customers are faced with time-consuming paperwork and bureaucracy when getting a claim reimbursed or signing up for a new insurance policy. Customers may also end up paying more for insurance because policies are not tailored for their unique needs. In an age when most of our daily activities are online, digitized and convenient, insurance is not always a happy customer experience.

That said, we are starting to see a global push by insurance companies to augment their technological capabilities so that they can do business faster, cheaper and more securely. In the past few years, there have been some prominent examples of insurers investing heavily in Artificial Intelligence solutions.

McKinsey estimates a potential annual value of up to $1.1 trillion if AI tech is fully applied to the Insurance industry. Of this, the business areas that can benefit the most are:

**Sales and marketing**: machine learning can be used to price insurance policies more competitively and relevantly and recommend useful products to customers. Insurers can price products based on individual needs and lifestyle so that customers only pay for the coverage they need. This increases the appeal of insurance to a wider range of customers, some of whom may then purchase insurance for the first time.

**Risk**: Neural networks can be used to recognize fraud patterns and reduce fraudulent claims. According to the FBI, non-health insurance fraud in the US is estimated at over $40 billion per year, which can cost families between $400–700 per year in extra premiums. Machine learning can also be used to improve insurance companies’ risks and actuarial models, which can potentially lead to more profitable products.

**Operations**: Chatbots using neural networks can be developed to understand and answer the bulk of customer queries over email, chat and phone calls. This can free up significant time and resources for insurers, which they can deploy towards more profitable activities.
